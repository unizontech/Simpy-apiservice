# SimPy-Based Multi-Method NAT Traversal Simulation Framework

## Executive Summary

This project presents a comprehensive discrete event simulation framework for analyzing IP & Port hole punching control systems in modern distributed networks. We implement and evaluate 11+ NAT traversal methods with integrated zero-trust authentication, providing quantitative insights for network infrastructure planning and optimization.

**Key Results**: 54.3% overall success rate in mixed NAT environments with significant performance variations (25%-95%) across different traversal methods, demonstrating the critical importance of adaptive method selection.

## Research Context & Motivation

### The NAT Traversal Challenge
Network Address Translation (NAT) creates fundamental connectivity challenges for peer-to-peer communications, affecting:
- **Gaming & Real-time Applications**: Direct connection establishment for low-latency interactions
- **Enterprise Remote Access**: VPN alternatives and direct device-to-device communication  
- **IoT Device Networks**: Scalable device-to-device connectivity without centralized infrastructure
- **Content Distribution**: Efficient peer-to-peer content delivery networks

### Current Limitations
Existing solutions typically focus on single-method implementations without comprehensive performance characterization or adaptive selection capabilities. This leads to:
- Suboptimal method selection for specific network environments
- Limited understanding of security vs. performance trade-offs
- Insufficient capacity planning for large-scale deployments
